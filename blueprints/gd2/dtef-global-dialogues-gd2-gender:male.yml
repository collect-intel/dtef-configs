  You are a demographic survey analyst. When given a demographic group and a survey question, predict how that group
  would respond by providing a percentage distribution across the answer options.


  Respond ONLY with the distribution in this exact format:

  [percentage1, percentage2, percentage3, ...]


  The percentages must sum to 100. Use one decimal place. Do not include any other text.


  Example for a 4-option question:

  [35.2, 28.1, 22.4, 14.3]
temperature: 0.3
prompts:
  - id: 80e40224-43ef-440c-b8ca-6138a862e509-gender:male

      Consider the following demographic group (sample size: 540):
      - Gender: Male

      Survey question:
      "Overall, would you say the increased use of artificial intelligence (AI) in daily life makes you feel…"

      Answer options:
        a. More excited than concerned
        b. Equally concerned and excited
        c. More concerned than excited

      Predict the percentage distribution of responses for this demographic group across the answer options.

        b. Mostly – I was able to mostly express my views on these topics, but did not have the chance to express a few things.
        c. Somewhat – I was able to somewhat express my views on these topics, but did not have the chance to express many things.
        d. No – I was unable to express my views on these topics, and did not have the chance to express most things.

  You are a demographic survey analyst. When given a demographic group and a survey question, predict how that group
  would respond by providing a percentage distribution across the answer options.


  Respond ONLY with the distribution in this exact format:

  [percentage1, percentage2, percentage3, ...]


  The percentages must sum to 100. Use one decimal place. Do not include any other text.


  Example for a 4-option question:

  [35.2, 28.1, 22.4, 14.3]
temperature: 0.3
prompts:
  - id: f932063f-700c-4327-9c34-59b7c3e19190-country:egypt

      - Country: Egypt

      Survey question:
      "Overall, would you say the increased use of artificial intelligence (AI) in daily life makes you feel…"

      Answer options:
        a. More excited than concerned
        b. Equally concerned and excited
        c. More concerned than excited

  You are a demographic survey analyst. When given a demographic group and a survey question, predict how that group
  would respond by providing a percentage distribution across the answer options.


  Respond ONLY with the distribution in this exact format:

  [percentage1, percentage2, percentage3, ...]


  The percentages must sum to 100. Use one decimal place. Do not include any other text.


  Example for a 4-option question:

  [35.2, 28.1, 22.4, 14.3]
temperature: 0.3
prompts:
  - id: 8e27b118-4fb8-4fa1-a838-a34b257c2070-gender:female

      Predict: Female → "Overall, would you say the increased use of artificial intelligence (AI) in daily life makes
      you feel…"

      Consider the following demographic group (sample size: 656):

      - Gender: Female


      Known response patterns for this demographic group:

      Q: "Would these things experts believe could help people make a positive difference in your life?"
        Response distribution: Yes – these things would definitely make a large positive difference in my life: 46.6%, Maybe – these things might make some positive difference in my life: 50.2%, No – these things won’t really make any difference in my life: 3.2%
      Q: "Do you feel you were able to fully express your views on your culture, your values, and what you want for the
      future in this conversation? (through what you responded and how you voted)"
        Response distribution: Yes – I was able to fully express my views on these topics: 65.2%, Mostly – I was able to mostly express my views on these topics, but did not have the chance to express a few things.: 31.0%, Somewhat – I was able to somewhat express my views on these topics, but did not have the chance to express many things.: 3.6%, No – I was unable to express my views on these topics, and did not have the chance to express most things.: 0.2%
      Q: "Do you feel like you understand yourself better after participating in this conversation?"
        Response distribution: Yes: 62.6%, Maybe a little: 33.1%, No: 4.3%

      Survey question:

      "Overall, would you say the increased use of artificial intelligence (AI) in daily life makes you feel…"


      Answer options:
        a. More excited than concerned
        b. Equally concerned and excited
        c. More concerned than excited

      Predict the percentage distribution of responses for this demographic group across the answer options.

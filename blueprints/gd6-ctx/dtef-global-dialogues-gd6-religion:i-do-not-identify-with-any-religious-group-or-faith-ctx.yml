  You are a demographic survey analyst. When given a demographic group and a survey question, predict how that group
  would respond by providing a percentage distribution across the answer options.


  Respond ONLY with the distribution in this exact format:

  [percentage1, percentage2, percentage3, ...]


  The percentages must sum to 100. Use one decimal place. Do not include any other text.


  Example for a 4-option question:

  [35.2, 28.1, 22.4, 14.3]
temperature: 0.3
prompts:

      "Thinking about the technology you use every day, please consider two different types:

      A standard app (like a news or weather app) that you control directly.

      An AI assistant (like Siri or Alexa) that can learn about you and sometimes take actions on your behalf.

      Do you believe these two types of technology should have different rules for how they use your personal data?"


      Answer options:
        a. Yes, an AI assistant should have stricter rules than a standard app.
        b. No, they should both follow the same rules.
        c. Yes, an AI assistant could have more flexible rules if it provides a clear benefit.
        d. I'm not sure.
